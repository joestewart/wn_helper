This module contains a number of hacky overrides and small helper functions to make Drupal's UI not suck. That said, there are some choices here that other developers might disagree with, such as hiding the Drupal core themes on the theme settings screen. But hey, we want things to look good. And our code is well documented. ;)

This module also contains some custom admin screens meant to help consolidate a site admin's job of managing a complex Drupal installation.
